Task 0

Print a random number and determinates if is positive, negative or zero
using if segments.

if (n > 0) ---> is positive
if (n < 0) ---> is negative
if (n = 0) ---> is zero

Task 1

Prints a random number and his last digits, after that using if segments
we determinate if the last digit is greater than 5, less than 6 and not 0, 
or if is 0.

if (last digit > 5)----> printf(is greater than 5)
if (last digit < 6 && last digit != 0)----> printf(is less than 6 and not 0)
else printf(is 0)---->

Task 2

Prints the alphabet only using putchar, with the function while we create a loop
and with a condition (alph <= 'z') (alph is a char) and (alph++) we go forward.

Task 3 

The same as Task 2 but we add another while with the condition (alph <= 'Z') (alph start at 'A')
and at the output we got the alphabet in lower and uppercase.

Task 4 

Prints the alphabet like the Task 2 but without the 'e' and 'q', for this we use an if condition
thats says (alph == 'e' || alph == 'q') ---> (alph = alph + 1) with that we skip 'e' and 'q'.
